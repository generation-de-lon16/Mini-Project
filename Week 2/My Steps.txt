1	Store products and orders-	Use lists for products and dictionaries for orders
2	Create a main menu-	Use while True so it runs continuously
3	Manage products-	Create functions to view, add, update, and delete products
4	Manage orders-	Create functions to view, add, update, and delete orders

1st Step: Setting up the  Structure
Creating a list to store product names for example "Mocha", "Americano"
Create an empty list for customer orders like orders()
Orders need to store multiple details (name, address, phone number, status), so I will use a dictionary inside the list

2nd Step: Build the Main Menu
The user needs a menu to choose what they want to do
The menu should keep running until they choose to exit → I will use a while True loop
The user can enter a number to:
View product options
View order options
Exit the program

3rd Step: Create the Product Menu
If the user picks Product Menu, I need another menu for:
Viewing all products
Adding a product
Updating a product
Deleting a product
Returning to the main menu
I will use another while True loop to keep the menu running until they exit...

4th Step: Viewing Products
I need to loop through the list and show all products with a number
The index number should be displayed next to each product
If the list is empty, display "No products available..."

5th Step: Adding a Product
Ask the user to type in a new product name
Add the product to the list using .append().
Display a message confirming the product was added.

6th Step: Updating a Product
Show the product list so the user can see the product numbers
Ask the user which product number they want to update
If they enter a valid number:
Ask for a new product name
Replace the old product with the new one

If they enter an invalid number.. show an error message

7th Step: Deleting a Product
Show the product list so the user can see product numbers
Ask the user to enter a number to delete
If the number is valid:
Use .pop() to fully remove the product from the list
If they enter an invalid number.. show an error message

8th Step: Create the Order Menu
If the user picks Order Menu, I need another menu for:
Viewing orders
Adding an order
Updating an order status
Updating order details (name, address, phone)
Deleting an order
Returning to the main menu
Another while True loop will keep this menu running until they exit.

9th Step: Viewing Orders
Show the order list with customer details.
If there are no orders, display "No orders yet.."

10th Step: Adding an Order
Ask the user for:
Customer name
Customer address
Customer phone number
The order must include a status, so it starts as "Preparing"
Store the details inside a dictionary and add it to the list

11th Step: Updating Order Status
Show all orders so the user can see order numbers
Ask the user which order number they want to update
If valid, show status options:
0 = Preparing
1 = Shipped
2 = Delivered
Change the order status based on the user’s choice

12th Step: Updating Order Details
Show all orders so the user can see order numbers
Ask the user which order number they want to update
Ask for a new name, address, and phone number
If they leave it blank, the old value stays the same

13 th Step: Deleting an Order
Show all orders so the user can see order numbers
Ask the user which order number to delete
If valid, remove the order from the list using .pop()
If invalid, show an error message

14th Step: Run the Program
Call main_menu() to start the program
The user can now:
Manage products
Manage orders
Exit the program when done
