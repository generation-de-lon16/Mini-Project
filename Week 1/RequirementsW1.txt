Mini Project Week 1


In this week we'll be building out the foundation of your app, in particular, the UI aspect.

This will make use of your ability to print to the screen, clear the screen, accept user input, and create a basic `list` data structure.

Try to make good use of functions for repetitive tasks.


As a user I want to:

create a product and add it to a list

view all products

STRETCH update or delete a product


Spec

- A `product` should just be a `string` containing its name, i.e: `"Mocha"`

- A list of `products` should be a list of `strings`, i.e: `["Mocha, Americano"]`


Pseudo Code


# add some product names

CREATE products list

PRINT main menu options

GET user input for main menu option


IF user input is 0:

EXIT app


# products menu

ELSE IF user input is 1:


PRINT product menu options

GET user input for product menu option


IF user input is 0:

RETURN to main menu


ELSE IF user input is 1:

PRINT products list


ELSE IF user input is 2:


# CREATE new product

GET user input for product name

APPEND product name to products list


ELSE IF user input is 3:


#STRETCH GOAL - UPDATE existing product


PRINT product names with its index value

GET user input for product index value

GET user input for new product name

UPDATE product name at index in products list


ELSE IF user input is 4:


# STRETCH GOAL - DELETE product


PRINT products list

GET user input for product index value

DELETE product at index in products list
