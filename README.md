Mini-Project 1: Cafe/Shop Management System

Introduction
Hello! This is my first Python project as part of my learning journey at Generation. I've created a simple command-line application to help manage a small cafe or shop. It lets you keep track of products, couriers and customer orders.

Features
Products Management: Add, view, update and delete cafe products
Couriers Management: Keep track of delivery people with similar functions
Orders Management: Create orders, update their status, change details or remove them
Data Persistence: All your products and couriers are saved to text files so they're still there when you restart the app

How to Use
Download the files to your computer
Make sure you have Python installed
Open your terminal
Navigate to the folder containing the files
Run the program by typing: python app3.py
Follow the on-screen menu to use the different features

Files Included
app3.py: The main program file
products.txt: Stores your products (created automatically)
couriers.txt: Stores your couriers (created automatically)
orders.txt: Will be used for order storage in future updates
What I Learned
While working on this project, I:

Improved my Python skills (functions, loops, conditional statements)
Learned how to use files for data storage
Developed a multi-level menu system
Gained experience in handling user input safely
Future Improvements
I'm planning to:

Add more features based on the tasks at Generation

Feedback
This is my first mini project, so I'd appreciate any feedback or suggestions :)

Thanks for looking at my work so far :)
